# Fine-grained-Visual-Analysis-Library

# Introduction
FGVAlib is an open-source and well documented library for Fine-grained Visual Analysis. It is based on Pytorch with performance and friendly API. Our code is pythonic, and the design is consistent with torchvision. You can easily develop new algorithms, or readily apply existing algorithms.

The currently supported algorithms include:

Fine-grained Image Classification
